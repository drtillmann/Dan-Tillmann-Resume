<h3>Bio</h3>
<p class="center">
I successfully graduated with an Associate in Applied Science - Computer Programming Degree and am ready to make my way into the world of software development! My schooling consisted of hands-on learning with many of the top computer languages
in order to graduate with a 3.39 GPA. My internship was one of those requirements where I logged 160 hours and used the languages PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and T-SQL.
Notepad ++, MySQL and XAMPP Server were what I used to produce my products. Currently, I use Notepad ++, MySQL, and WAMP Server at home for continuing my education on my own.<br/><br/>

I was assigned many projects during my time at my internship, but the one project that I had the most fun accomplishing was coding a calendar. My team lead gave me the task of writing a dynamic calendar for their Fun 4 Kids 
website. This calendar would display any event on a certain day and dynamically change from month to month. 
The activities to be displayed were stored in a MySQL database and writing the script to query which information to use was the easy part. 
I was able to complete the calendar in two days by using PHP, T-SQL, HTML5, and CSS3.<br/><br/> 

My classes consisted of much more than PHP and T-SQL. I had hands-on training in JAVA, C#, ASP.NET, VISUAL BASIC.NET, ANDROID, HTML5, CSS3, and JAVASCRIPT. 
I am learning JQuery on my own and I used it in the development of my resume webpage. In addition to the software I use at home, I use Eclipse, Visual Studios 2012 and SQL Server 2012 to make projects in 
JAVA, C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET and ANDROID.<br/><br/>

I particularly enjoy coding projects that require a database connection - I enjoy manipulating data. I enjoy it all, from writing scripts that create the table in the database to scripts that query the data and then creating
the UI that displays what I queried.<br/><br/>

I am a fast learner and I work very hard at goals for my job and in my personal life. </p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p class="center">I am seeking an entry-level Software Development position with a growing company.
I am ready to contribute to an amazing team of developers and I am always ready to learn new skills that will help me become an invaluable asset.
